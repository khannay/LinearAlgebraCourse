\section*{Directions:}
The below questions require the use of scientific computing software. You will most likely want to use Matlab or Octave for this as I have provided some code for your use in those languages. You should compile all your results and plots in a typed report to be turned in electronically on S1. 

 You are encouraged to use online resources and talk with one another about your projects. However, each person is responsible for writing up their own report. This report should be uploaded to S1 by 11:55 PM on the final class day of the semester 5/4/2018.  

\section*{Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \underline{Leslie Matrices:} 
One application of linear algebra is to age-structured population models in ecology. Let $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N $ represent the population (number of individuals) in a population in $N$ different age categories. 
Let's consider a concrete example, and say we want to model the population of birds where $N$ are the years the bird has been alive. For example, we may have:
\begin{equation}
x^0=
\begin{bmatrix}
100 &
65 &
45 &
33 &
15
\end{bmatrix}^T
\end{equation}
This tells us there are 100 birds which are age 1 (hatched this year), 65 birds which are year 2, etc. Lets use the superscript to indicate how many years have elapsed (so we start with $x^0$ to indicate that is the starting value). This bird species is classified as endangered as we only have $238$ total birds in the population. 

Now we may want to take this data in predict the population in future years. The diagram below shows a graphical version of our model. 
\begin{center}
 \begin{tikzpicture}[font=\sffamily]
    \node[state,
          text=yellow,
          draw=none,
          fill=gray!50!black] (y1) {Y1};
    \node[state,
          right=2cm of y1,
          text=blue!30!white, 
          draw=none, 
          fill=gray!50!black] (y2) {Y2};
          
         \node[state,
          right=2cm of y2,
          text=blue!30!white, 
          draw=none, 
          fill=gray!50!black] (y3) {Y3};
          
         \node[state,
          right=2cm of y3,
          text=blue!30!white, 
          draw=none, 
          fill=gray!50!black] (y4) {Y4};
          
           \node[state,
          right=2cm of y4,
          text=blue!30!white, 
          draw=none, 
          fill=gray!50!black] (y5) {Y5};
 
    % Connect the states with arrows
    \draw[every loop,
          auto=right,
          line width=1mm,
          >=latex,
          draw=orange,
          fill=orange]
        (y1) edge[auto=left]  node {$s_{1}$} (y2)
        (y2) edge[auto=left]  node {$s_{2}$} (y3)
        (y3) edge[auto=left]  node {$s_{3}$} (y4)
        (y4) edge[auto=left]  node {$s_{4}$} (y5)
        (y3) edge[bend right, auto=right, draw=red, style=dashed] node {$b_{3}$} (y1)
         (y4) edge[bend left, auto=right, draw=red, style=dashed] node {$b_{4}$} (y1);
%        (s) edge[loop above]             node {0.4} (s)
%        (r) edge[loop above]             node {0.3} (r);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}





The $\{Y1,Y2, ...\}$ nodes show the states of being a first year bird, etc. The arrows show the allowed transitions between the states. Lets start with the orange (solid) arrows. They give the fraction of the population which survives the year. For instance, $s_{1}$ gives the fraction of first year birds who survive to be a second year bird. 

The red (dashed) arrows indicate the breeding process. $b_3$ is the average number of baby birds produced by a third year bird in a given year, and $b_4$ is the average number of baby birds produced by a fourth year bird. Evidently, for the species of bird we are studying they can only reproduce in their third and fourth years of life. Perhaps, when they are in their first and second years they are to young and those who are fifth year birds are too old. 

We can translate this graphical version in to a matrix model for our bird population where the can predict the age structured population after $t$ years using the previous year $x^{t-1}$
\begin{equation}
x^{t}=Lx^{t-1} \\
\end{equation}
where $L$ is a matrix called the \textit{Leslie Matrix} for the population:
\begin{equation}
L=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & b_3 & b_4 & 0 \\
s_1 & 0 &0 &0 &0 \\
0 & s_2 &0 &0 &0 \\
0 &0 & s_3 &0 & 0 \\
0 &0 & 0 & s_4 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Using the bird population model above answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $b_3=b_4=2$ and $s_1=0.20$, $s_2=0.50$ and $s_3=s_4=0.80$ and $x^0$ is as given above, make a graph of the total population (sum of the vector) as a function of time. What happens to the total bird population? 
\item For the same parameter values as the first question does it matter what the initial population $x_0$ is? Do all initial conditions lead to the same final state for the total population?
\item Lets say that a conservation program is put in to place for this bird species, designed to increase the survival of the first year birds. Under this conservation program $s_1=0.50$, with all the other parameters being the same. If we start at the $x^0$ given above what happens to the bird population now over the long term? Make a graph of the total population for the first 20 years.
\item For the conservation program can you find a initial condition where we start with 258 birds (just like the $x^0$ above) where the birds go extinct? What does this tell you about just using the total population as a measure of the health of a population?
\item Let's say the government cuts the funding for the conservation program after 10 years (starting from $x^0$ above ) because the bird population has recovered enough to no longer be endangered. When the funding is cut $s_1$ drops back to 0.20 again. What will happen to the total bird population over the next ten years after the funding is cut? What lesson can you learn from this simulation? 
\item What is the minimum value of the $0 \leq s_1 \leq 1$ parameter where the bird population will grow over time? 
\end{enumerate}

\item \underline{Image Processing: } 
In this question you will use the \textit{singular value decomposition} to compress an image. I have written a matlab(octave) function to do much of this for you. Download the matlab function image\_compression.m and the image file gilbert\_strang.jpg. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the image compression function to compress the image by dropping all singular values but the first 1,10,20,50 components. Save the resulting images and make a portfolio of these images. 
\item How many components do we need to include before the loss of information is no longer apparent to the human eye?
\item Find the svd of the image, and plot the singular values. 
\item Can you see how the svd can be used to compress the storage required for image files? Hint: Store just the needed singular vectors and values and compute the full image only when required. 
\end{enumerate}

\item \underline{Random Matrices:} We may generate random matrices in Matlab using the command randn(n) this will create a matrix where each entry is drawn from the standard normal distribution. To make sure the variance of these matrices doesn't grow with the size of the matrix we will study matrices of the form A=randn(n) $\times 1/\sqrt{n}$. 

It turns out that matrices with random entries have some very predictable properties when we consider the \textit{spectrum} (the eigenvalues) of the matrix. The below matlab code creates a random 1000 by 1000 matrix and plots the eigenvalues in the complex plane (real part on the x-axis and imaginary part on the y axis). 

\lstinputlisting{random_matrix_demo.m}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What shape do the eigenvalues form in the complex plane? How does this depend on the size of the random matrix? Try N=10,20,50,100,500,1000 and include these plots in your report.  What happens as the size of the matrices increases?
\item Generate a random network using the command:
\begin{lstlisting}
N=double(abs(randn(1000))<0.1);
\end{lstlisting}
\item How many edges are in this random network?
\item Make a plot of the eigenvalues of this network in the complex plane. Does the spectrum of this matrix take the same shape?
\item Plot the spectrum when you change the matrix to:
\begin{lstlisting}
N2=double(abs(randn(1000))<0.01);
\end{lstlisting}
\item How many edges are in your N2 network? What can you conclude about random networks following the rule you found above?
\end{enumerate}

%\item \underline{Perturbation Theory for Matrices:}
%Work out first order perturbation theory and observe it effects numerically and analytically. 




\end{enumerate}
